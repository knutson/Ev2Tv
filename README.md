This is an example of how to obtain the vibrational temperature, Tv, of 5 species (N2, O2, NO, N, O) air given the vibrational energy, Ev, using Newton's method. A simple harmonic oscillator model is used to represent vibrational excitation of diatomic species. The Newton iterations continue until the magnitude of the temperature update is less than 1/1,000,000 K. In this example, the exact vibrational temperature is 6,414 K by construction.
