This is an example of how to obtain the vibrational temperature, Tv, of 5 species (N2, O2, NO, N, O) air given the vibrational energy, Ev, using Newton's method. A simple harmonic oscillator model is used to represent vibrational excitation of diatomic species. The Newton iterations continue until the magnitude of the temperature update is less than 1/1,000,000 K. In this example, the exact vibrational temperature is 6,414 K by construction. Starting with an initial guess of Tv = 5,000 K, the expected output is:

  Tv = 5000.0000000000000 K<br/>
  Tv = 6425.4208015159174 K<br/>
  Tv = 6414.0004497924701 K<br/>
  Tv = 6414.0000000000018 K<br/>
  Tv = 6414.0000000000000 K
